# phaserquest
A first attempt at making a clean typescript, webpacked dev setup for a Phaser js project

## Setup
Make sure you have [Node, NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), and [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-stable) installed.

Run "yarn" to install dependencies.

## Running project

"yarn dev" to webpack and start a webpack server. Open up localhost:8080 in your browser to load the game.

"yarn build" to output a production build.
